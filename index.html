    <h1>Julian Garcia-Schroeder</h1>
    <h3>Full Stack Engineer</h3>
    <img src="./assets/images/Selfie.png" alt="Picture of me" height="200" />
    <p>
      Graduated with my Bachelor's in Computer Information Systems from Park
      University and thereafter worked for almost a year at Grand Canyon
      Education as an IT Analyst. Progressed to a level III tech during my time
      there while simultaenously studying for my Master of Science in
      Cybersecurity at the university. I had to put these studies on pause,
      however, as I landed an opportunity to teach English part time in Spain
      for about a year. During my time here in Spain I am polishing up my coding
      skills as I am currently in a Full Stack Web Developer bootcamp, and upon
      my return, plan on being qualified to land at least a junior developer
      role somewhere in the states.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would like to mention that I also played baseball for the three years I
      was at Park, so I consider myself to be a team player with great
      leadership skills and a high motor for accomplishing tasks/adapting to new
      challenges.
